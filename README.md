## Approach

0) Researched and learnt the basic getting started syntax and processes
1) Introduced to Create React App for quick starting without setting up from scratch
2) Working with React without Babel and Gulp and other 3rd party toolkits
3) Set up the basic HTML doms in the App.js render function
4) Modularized code into individual _components_ and imported in App.js
5) Finally, used Router to route to components using URIs
6) Obtained some skeletel CSS from existing resources and modified according to taste

## Take away
Learnt a lot about React (had some idea from earlier but faded in memory) and the use of _components_ and _state_. Researched a little about _Redux_ as well for state management but did not end up using it as it was not required at this stage.

Defintely interested in picking up React and learning more in-depth preferably through an online course and not just documentation (not that great) and YouTube tutorials.

At the end, still a novice at React but it's easy to pick up due to my JS skills and ES6 involvement in React. As the documentation of React states "you can use as little or as much React as you need" so to get further involved in it, a lot more is to be studied instead of relying more on tutorials and look ups. Documentation is okay for looking up syntax when forgotten but not to learn what the framework provides at an advanced level.
